      <p class="title">Al Mawakeb Innovation Center</p>
      <p class="text">
        The Al Mawakeb Innovation Center (AMIC) is a specialized program for highly motivated and talented high school students in grades 10, 11, and 12 who are passionate about technology and innovation. Our goal is to foster scientific thinking, inspire creative solutions to challenges, cultivate independent scientific leaders, and promote a passion for science among younger generations. We provide a platform for immersive experiences, prestigious events, and research opportunities.
        <br><br>
        AMIC offers experiential learning through hands-on activities, workshops, and events that apply technology concepts in real-world scenarios. Members undertake a main project each year, solving problems or creating innovative solutions. We prioritize research and innovation, encouraging members to conduct original research and explore technological advancements.
        <br><br>
        Admission to AMIC is by application only, ensuring a selective and dedicated cohort of students. The admission process involves an application survey and an in-person interview. We provide exclusive events like Mawakeb Innovates, where students can showcase their technological solutions and creative ideas, as well as participate in STEM activities, workshops, and competitions.
        <br><br>
        AMIC members have the opportunity to present their research and projects at the annual Mawakeb science symposium, participate in national-level events, and visit technology-related exhibitions. We foster a collaborative environment where students can work together, exchange ideas, and enhance their teamwork and leadership skills. AMIC members are exempted from social studies and moral subjects to focus on their technological endeavors.
        <br><br>
        To attract high-achieving students, we implement a comprehensive advertising and promotion strategy, utilizing social media, posters, presentations, and other channels. Mr. Youssef Semaan serves as the academic mentor and guides students' academic journey, while a new President is elected yearly to ensure fairness.
        <br><br>
        Join AMIC and be part of a vibrant community of passionate students dedicated to technology and innovation.
